            <p>
              A relationship is any connection between two people, which can be either positive or negative.
  
              You can have a relationship with a wide range of people, including family and friends. The phrase "being in
              a
              relationship," while often linked with romantic relationships, can refer to various associations one person
              has with another.
  
              To "be in a relationship" doesn't always mean there is physical intimacy, emotional attachment, and/or
              commitment involved. People engage in many different types of relationships that have unique
              characteristics.
            </p>
            <h1>
              Basic Types of Relationships
            </h1>
            <p>
              Relationships typically fall into one of several different categories (although these can sometimes
              overlap):
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Family relationships</li>
              <li>Friendships</li>
              <li>Acquaintances</li>
              <li>Romantic relationships</li>
              <li>Sexual relationships</li>
              <li>Work relationships</li>
              <li>Situational relationships (sometimes called "situationships")</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These different forms of relationships can vary greatly in terms of closeness, and there are also different
              subtypes of relationships within each of these basic types. Some of the different kinds of relationships
              that
              you might experience at some point in your life include the following
            </p>
            <p>
              While there are many different types of relationships, the four main types are typically identified as
              family
              relationships, romantic relationships, friendships, and acquaintanceships.
            </p>
            <h1>Platonic Relationships </h1>
            <p>
              A platonic relationship is a type of friendship that involves a close, intimate bond without sex or romance.
              These relationships tend to be characterized by:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Closeness</li>
              <li>Fondness</li>
              <li>Understanding</li>
              <li>Respect</li>
              <li>Care</li>
              <li>Support</li>
              <li>Honesty </li>
              <li>Acceptance</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Such relationships often exist on a continuum that varies in the levels of frequency of contact, type of
              contact, amount of personal disclosure, discussion of the relationship, and degree of friendship. The study
              found that people with more sexual experience were better able to identify the definitions of these labels
              compared to people with less sexual experience.
  
              Casual relationships are often common among young adults. As long as casual relationships are marked by
              communication and consent, they can have several sex-positive benefits. They can satisfy the need for sex,
              intimacy, connection, and companionship without the emotional demand and energy commitment of a more serious
              relationship.4
            </p>
            <h1>
              Open Relationships
            </h1>
            <p>
              An open relationship is a type of consensually non-monogamous relationship in which one or more partners
              have
              sex or relationships with other people. Both people agree to have sex with other people in an open
              relationship but may have certain conditions or limitations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Open relationships can take place in any type of romantic relationship, whether casual, dating, or married.
  
              There tends to be a stigma surrounding non-monogamous relationships. Still, research suggests that around
              21%
              to 22% of adults will be involved in some type of open relationship at some point in their life.5
            </p>
            <h1>
              Toxic Relationships
            </h1>
            <p>
              A toxic relationship is any type of interpersonal relationship where your emotional, physical, or
              psychological well-being is undermined or threatened in some way. Such relationships often leave you feeling
              ashamed, humiliated, misunderstood, or unsupported.
  
              Any type of relationship can be toxic including friendships, family relationships, romantic relationships,
              or
              workplace relationships.
  
              Toxic relationships are characterized by:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>A lack of support</li>
              <li>Blaming</li>
              <li>Competitiveness</li>
              <li>Controlling behaviors</li>
              <li>Disrespect</li>
              <li>Dishonesty</li>
              <li>Gaslighting</li>
              <li>Hostility</li>
              <li>Jealousy</li>
              <li>Passive-aggressive behaviors</li>
              <li>Poor communication</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Sometimes all people in a relationship play a role in creating this toxicity. For example, you may be
              contributing to toxicity if you are all consistently unkind, critical, insecure, and negative
            </p>
            <p>
              In other cases, one person in a relationship may behave in ways that create toxic feelings. This may be
              intentional, but in other cases, people may not fully understand how they are affecting other people.
              Because
              of their past experiences with relationships, often in their home growing up, they may not know any other
              way
              of acting and communicating.
            </p>
            <p>
              This doesn't just create discontentment—toxic relationships can take a serious toll on your health. For
              example, according to one study, stress caused by negative relationships has a direct impact on
              cardiovascular
              health.6 Feeling isolated and misunderstood in a relationship can also lead to loneliness, which has been
              shown to have detrimental effects on both physical and mental health
            </p>
            <p>
              Toxic relationships can be stressful, harmful, and even abusive. If you are in a toxic relationship with
              someone in your life, work on creating strong boundaries to protect yourself. Talk to a mental health
              professional or consider terminating the relationship if it is causing you harm.
            </p>
            <p>

            <h1>Defining Your Relationship </h1>
            <p>
              How you define your relationship depends on various factors, including what matters to you and how the other
              person feels. To define your relationship, it can be helpful to ask a few questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Do you have romantic feelings for one another?</li>
              <li>What does each person hope to get out of the relationship?</li>
              <li>How much time do you want to spend together?</li>
              <li>Where do you see the relationship going?</li>
              <li>Are you currently involved with or want to be involved with other people?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Figuring out what matters to you and your partner is an important step in defining the type of relationship
              you are interested in having. You might find that you are both on the same page or discover that you want
              different things out of your relationship.<br><br>
  
              Defining your relationship doesn't have to mean committing for the long-term. Instead, it can be a way to
              help
              you both better understand the boundaries and expectations of your relationship.
            </p>
            <h1>How to Keep Your Relationship Healthy</h1>
            <p>
              Regardless of how you define your relationship, there are important steps you can take to ensure that your
              connection is healthy. Strategies that can help include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Showing appreciation and gratitude</li>
              <li>Communicating openly and honestly</li>
              <li>Being affectionate and showing that you care </li>
              <li>Mutual respect </li>
              <li>Actively listenin</li>
              <li>Showing interest in each other</li>
              <li>Being supportive and encouraging</li>
              <li>Feeling empathy for each other</li>
              <li>Spending time together</li>
              <li>Having healthy boundaries</li>
              <li>Being trustworthy</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Communication is often the single most important thing in a relationship.7 Good relationships are also
              marked
              by honesty, trust, and reciprocity. This doesn't mean that the relationship is purely transactional; it
              indicates that you naturally engage in a give and take that provides mutually beneficial support.
            </p>
            <h1>
              A Word From Verywell
            </h1>
            <p>
              No matter what type of relationship you have with another person(s), it is important for it to be a healthy
              one. Healthy relationships are characterized by trust, mutual respect, openness, honesty, and affection.
              Good
              communication is also a hallmark of a healthy relationship.<br><br>
  
              There are steps that you can take to improve your relationships with other people. Making sure you let
              others
              know you care and showing your appreciation are two strategies that can be helpful.<br><br>
  
              But if a relationship is causing stress or shows signs of being toxic, look for ways to establish clear
              boundaries, talk to a therapist, or even consider ending the relationship if it is too unhealthy.<br><Br>
  
              Social relationships are important and they come in all different types. Having a variety of relationships
              with different people can ensure that you have the support and connections you need for your emotional
              health
              and well-being.
            </p>
